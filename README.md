# LLMGuard-K8s-AI üõ°Ô∏èü§ñ

An LLM-powered auditing tool for Kubernetes, specializing in identifying security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps for AI/ML/LLM workloads. It provides contextual, human-readable insights and actionable remediation advice.

## üåü Why LLMGuard?

Securing AI workloads on Kubernetes presents unique challenges. Standard K8s security tools may miss AI-specific risks, and interpreting complex configurations can be difficult. LLMGuard leverages the power of Large Language Models to:

*   **Understand Context:** Analyze K8s configurations *in the context of AI workloads*.
*   **Provide Clear Explanations:** Generate human-readable descriptions of risks and detailed remediation steps.
*   **Focus on AI-Specific Threats:** Identify vulnerabilities related to training data, model integrity, inference endpoints, and resource abuse.
*   **Assist with Compliance:** Help map K8s configurations to AI-relevant compliance standards (e.g., CIS Benchmarks, NIST AI RMF).
*   **(Future)** Allow natural language policy queries and translation.

## ‚ú® Key Features (Planned & In-Progress)

*   **Kubernetes Manifest Analysis:** Scans Deployments, Pods, Services, NetworkPolicies, RBAC, etc.
*   **IaC Scanning:** Supports Terraform (HCL) and Pulumi (Python/TS) for K8s cluster configurations.
*   **MLOps/LLMOps Stack Awareness:** Checks for common misconfigurations in tools like Kubeflow, MLflow, Seldon Core deployed on K8s.
*   **AI-Specific Security Checks:**
    *   Data exfiltration paths for training data.
    *   Insecure model serving endpoints.
    *   Overly permissive access to GPU resources.
    *   Unnecessary hostPath mounts.
*   **LLM-Generated Risk Explanations & Remediation Guides.**
*   **Compliance Mapping:** Cross-references findings with CIS K8s Benchmarks, NIST AI RMF principles.
*   **Extensible Check System:** Ability to add custom checks.
*   **Reporting:** JSON, Markdown, and (future) HTML reports.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack (Tentative)

*   Python 3.x
*   LLM API: OpenAI API (GPT-3.5/4), or self-hosted models via Hugging Face Transformers/vLLM.
*   Kubernetes Interaction: `kubernetes` Python client.
*   IaC Parsing: `python-hcl2`, relevant Pulumi SDKs.
*   CLI: `click` or `typer`.
*   (Optional) Vector Database: For embedding knowledge base articles for RAG with LLM.
